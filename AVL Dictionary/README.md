### AVL Dictionary is a final project assignment in the course Data Structures,
#### The goal of this project is to implement a rather efficient Dictionary in means of Time Complexity (less efficient than hash-table, but still pretty elegant).
#### The Dictionary is implemented with the ADT - AVL Tree.
#### An AVL Tree is a balanced binary search tree, that stays balanced, as it will balance itself to keep having a height of Ï´(log(n)).
#### The binary tree implementation is used here to sort the keys(which are strings) in alphabetic order.
